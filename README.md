- 👋 Hi, I’m @LCollatz
- 👀 I’m interested in a proof of the Collazu comjektire
- 🌱 I am a retired engineer and work on mathematical problems such as the Collatz conjecture for which I have found a proof. I would like to discuss this proof with other mathematically competent people.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...Sie können mich unter >HarDieFri42@gmail.com< erreichen.
- 😄
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...The proof is easier than finding an expert who can determine and confirm its accuracy.
